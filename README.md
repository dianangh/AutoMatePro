## Design

## Service microservice

Explain your models and integration with the inventory
microservice, here.

I'll create a service API that will handle all the automobile service appointments and a service poller that will integrate with the other sales microservice. I'll have a SalesRecordVO, Technician and Appointment model. The SalesRecordVo will take right from the sales microservice and provide reference to whether a car is eligible for vip status or not.
